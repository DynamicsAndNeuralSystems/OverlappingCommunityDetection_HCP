# Overlapping Community Detection: HCP Structural Connectome

Code to apply and assess the results of overlapping community-detection algorithms on a right-hemisphere structural connectome estimated from Human Connectome Project data.

Depends on a toolbox for fitting benchmark overlapping networks and comparing the performance of algorithms on these networks: [here](https://github.com/NeuralSystemsAndSignals/OverlappingCommunityDetection).

Main results can be reproduced as follows:
